# Web Scraping

Web scraping, also known as web harvesting or data scraping, is the process of using software bots to extract data and content from a website. Web scrapers are programmed to gather the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code and any data stored in a website's database. This data can then be saved to a local file for analysis and manipulation. 
Web scraping is different from screen scraping, which only copies the pixels displayed on a screen. Web scraping can be used for a variety of purposes, including: 
## Price comparison
Price comparison sites use web scrapers to automatically fetch prices and product descriptions from other websites. 
## Market research
Market research companies use web scrapers to gather data from social media and forums. 
## E-commerce
Web scrapers can be used to extract product data, prices, descriptions, and images. 
## Retail monitoring
Web scrapers can monitor product performance, competitor stock, and pricing. 
Brand monitoring
Web scrapers can be used to crawl social content for sentiment analysis and product reviews. 
Web scraping can be used for legitimate purposes, but it can also be used for illegal purposes, such as stealing copyrighted content or undercutting prices.
